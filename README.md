# burger-logger

Burger logger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Usage:
By pulling up the website using the deployed heroku app, the user can input the type of burger they want and see it get pushed to the "Burgers Ready" list with an option to "Eat It!", once devoured, the burger will change to the "Devoured Burgers" list.
